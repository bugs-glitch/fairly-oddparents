	<character name="Timmy Turner" copy="Timmy Turner is just like every other kid on Earth—totally powerless against the adults of the world! He's smarter than most of them too, which makes it even MORE frustrating. He's got most of the things normal kids have, like school and friends and stuff, but he's also got one thing most other kids DON'T have—Fairy Godparents. What's a smart kid like Timmy going to do with all that magical power? Goooood question..." icon="/shows/data/fairlyoddparents/multimedia/fop/characters/icons/headTimmy.swf" image="/shows/data/fairlyoddparents/multimedia/fop/characters/timmy.swf"></character>
	<character name="Cosmo" copy="Cosmo is Timmy's Fairy Godfather. On the intelligence meter, this guy's no brain surgeon. In fact, you wouldn't use the word ''brain'' to describe Cosmo at all. He means well and he sure is FUNNY, but his magic wand has been known to invite mayhem into the life of his latest assignment—Timmy Turner." icon="/shows/data/fairlyoddparents/multimedia/fop/characters/icons/headCosmo.swf" image="/shows/data/fairlyoddparents/multimedia/fop/characters/cosmo.swf"></character>
	<character name="Wanda" copy="Wanda's no genius, but she's a real whiz with a wand. And at least she knows when to quit fooling around and get down to business—most of the time! When Cosmo and Timmy are totally lost, they both turn to Wanda for wisdom. Luckily, she usually has half a clue!" icon="/shows/data/fairlyoddparents/multimedia/fop/characters/icons/headWanda.swf" image="/shows/data/fairlyoddparents/multimedia/fop/characters/wanda.swf"></character>
	<character name="Vicky" copy="The meanest teen in the toon, Vicky's real name is probably Icky—they just threw on the V for cosmetic reasons. She's mean. Downright mean. Her one joy in life, other than watching TV, is making things tough for that ''twerp'' Timmy she babysits for all the time. If it weren't for a pair of problematic pixies, life would be a breeze for Vicky..." icon="/shows/data/fairlyoddparents/multimedia/fop/characters/icons/headVicky.swf" image="/shows/data/fairlyoddparents/multimedia/fop/characters/vicky.swf"></character>
	<character name="A.J." copy="A.J. plays resident genius in Timmy's crew. He's got the biggest brains of the three pals, and Timmy's one smart cookie himself. A.J. will be the one to invent a pocket teleporter or something, he just hasn't gotten around to it yet. Between his brains, Chester's street smarts and Timmy's leadership, these three twerps just might have what it takes to survive the adults, Fairy Godparents and evil babysitters of the world!" icon="/shows/data/fairlyoddparents/multimedia/fop/characters/icons/headAJ.swf" image="/shows/data/fairlyoddparents/multimedia/fop/characters/aj.swf"></character>
	<character name="Chester" copy="Thanks goodness Timmy's got a friend like Chester. Chester's an opportunist, you see, and he's always got the excuse, scam or plan the moment calls for. Sure, his schemes land Timmy in some hot water every once in a while, but it's not like Chester means it—he's just trying to have a little fun, you know?" icon="/shows/data/fairlyoddparents/multimedia/fop/characters/icons/headChester.swf" image="/shows/data/fairlyoddparents/multimedia/fop/characters/chester.swf"></character>
